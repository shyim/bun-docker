# Bun Docker Image

This Repository builds Bun Docker image for amd64/arm64 with [Ubuntu Chisel](https://github.com/canonical/chisel) to produce a very small docker image.

## How is the Docker Image so small?

Chisel installs only the bare minimum of the required packages aka only library files. So to the pre-built bun binary, only an additional 8MB of libraries are added.

This reduces also the attack vector of the image, as nothing is installed as bun + bash and the required libraries.
